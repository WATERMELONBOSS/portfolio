# Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work, projects, research, and interests. It's a static site with a custom design, fully responsive, and hosted using GitHub Pages.

Everything — from the layout to the interactions — has been coded from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with some additional libraries like tsParticles and Font Awesome). I keep the site updated as I build new projects or gain new experience.

### Deployment
This site is live at: [https://watermelonboss.github.io/portfolio](https://watermelonboss.github.io/portfolio)

### How I update it
I make changes locally in VS Code and push them directly to the `main` branch of this repo. GitHub Pages handles the rest.

### License
MIT

No frameworks. No templates. Just a personal site, hand-built and always a work in progress.
